# dancing-planets
A visualization of planets orbiting a center of mass, making a geometric drawing as they orbit 
which varies and shape according to their orbital radius and velocity.

I've seen this many times on YouTube and other sites so i had to  have it and add my own styles and colors. 
It 's so fun to implement as well as to play with, hope you find it fun too, [try it yourself](https://mohammed0xff.github.io/dancing-planets/src/index.html).
